The system is organised into several key modules, each dedicated to handling specific tasks within the analysis pipeline. This modular framework enhances flexibility, allowing users to adapt the software to various complex scenarios, including the detailed study of crack propagation and material behaviour under stress. Examples of how to validate the code are provided in "InputDesk_Validate", and an example of how to use the code with typical DIC data is shown in "Straigh_Crack_input_Desk".
